Mercedes AMG performance specialist Weistec Engineering runs back to back 10-second passes in
its modified AMG GT-S.

Anaheim, Calif. (October, 2015) – Weistec Engineering, the brand of choice for the cars, community, 
and culture of the Mercedes AMG enthusiast, has set a new benchmark for performance with the AMG GT. 
On Friday, October 10, 2015, Weistec ran consecutive 10-second quarter mile passes at the Auto Club Dragway in 
Fontana, California, solidifying its car the quickest AMG GT in the world.

The AMG GT is a serious performer right off of the showroom floor, thanks to its twin-turbocharged 4.0L V8 
with 503 horsepower and 479 ft-lb of torque. But if there is one thing the engineers at Weistec know, it is 
that there is plenty more potential under the hood of these cars just waiting to be unlocked. For this first 
test, Weistec’s goal was to show what was capable with the factory turbochargers along with their basic upgrades 
and calibrations. These upgrades include the new Weistec high flow air filters, VTA adapters, high-flow downpipe 
and mid-pipe, coilover suspension, and engine calibration. After the vehicle received the Weistec upgrades it 
gained a whopping 147 HP and 257 ft-lbs of torque, putting the car at 670 horsepower and 755 ft-lb of torque. 
This allowed Weistec to pick up over a half-second in the ¼ mile over the car in factory trim, running the 
quarter mile in 10.8 seconds at 126.25 miles per hour.
